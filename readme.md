## What is this?
This is an opinionated JavaScript framework/application Skeleton for NodeJS applications.

## Why?
Because I wanted an easy-to-use system that was more familiar to my PHP roots. PRs are welcome, but will be reviewed-heavily for any major changes.

## Okay but how do I install it?
That is currently being worked on....

This whole project is still very much a WIP, and hopefully it won't die :smile:

```
npm install fringejs
```

Once installed, all you have to do is require the package. 

```
require('fringejs')
```

Now that it's required, you can now access it via the `app` keyword. The app keyword is an instance of our `Container` class.
